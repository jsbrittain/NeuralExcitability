# NeuralExcitability

These simulations, which were developed in JavaScript as part of a package of workshops for use in University-level teaching can be run interactively on [jsbrittain.com/interactive-teaching](http://www.jsbrittain.com/interactive-teaching.html).

## LatInhib
### Neuron excitability
Designed to reinforce the idea that neurons encode information, this simulation allows students to wire up the 'inputs' to a cell in order to understand what is required to make that cell fire, such as the need for co-operativity (synchronised input), tetanic stimulation, etc.

## EdgeDetect
### Edge Detection
Simulation of receptive field properties and how they influence a 'target' cell. These can be conceptualised as cutaneous (skin) receptors responding to touch. A simple challenge would be to connect the receptive fields to the target cell in such a way that the presence of an Edge will cause the target cell to fire, while the cell remains silent when a Rotated Edge or Flat Panel are presented.

## ArmSim
### Arm Muscle Control
Simulation of basic arm muscle control to demonstrate the complexities of control signals required to perform even a basic motor task. Challenges include maintaining time on target with only one muscle, both muscles using antagonist activation, and/or switching between one and two targets.
